### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height) - This helped me understand how min-height(can't be inherited), max-height and height are related to each other and how the final height of the container is calculated.

- [resource 2](https://chat.openai.com/c/1d0d26db-95b1-4bdd-a3ca-f347739d37a2) - ChatGPT helped me understand the CSS documentation of w3c which further helped me understand the min-height property.
